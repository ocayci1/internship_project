# internship_project
  
  The project I did during my internship at Bimser Cozum Yazilim Tic. A.S.
  
  It is about creating a simple cloud web app using CephFS as the storage location
  and using HMTL5, Bootstrap, AJAX JQuery and PHP to create the web app which uploads
  documents to the directory, displays and deletes documents in the directory.
